# Michael's Overly Opinionated Bootstrapping Script

This script installs all the packages and fonts I like. It works well on a clean 
install of Fedora 29, otherwise your mileage may vary.

## Usage

```sh
git clone https://github.com/michaelauderer/MOOBS.git
cd MOOBS
sudo ./MOOBS.sh
```

## List of what it installs

Read the damn script. If you can't understand basic bash, you shouldn't be
running random install scripts with super permissions. (Honestly, I just don't want to 
maintain a list. Seriously, read the script.)
